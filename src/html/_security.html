<h4>Your Data and Account Access</h4>
<p>
    Swellcoin displays your transactions and earned / spent cashback with member businesses in secure user accounts, accessible by you via your password. All passwords are further encrypted by hashing algorithms. The only person who knows the password you choose is you. This means that even we can't see your password, nor will we ever ask you to provide it. Our day-to-day operations do not require staff to access or interact with your customer data. For this reason, the number of Swellcoin staff that can access your financial data is zero. For your privacy, once your cashback is calculated, all personally identifying information is removed from the data, other than what is stored in your user account(s). In the event that you have any questions regarding past transactions and related cashback history, the information must be requested again from the secure servers at Finicity. Such can only be performed by our managerial personnel with strictly guarded authorization, and only for the time period in question. Such retrieval will follow all the same bank level secure protocols.
