<h4>Our Commitment</h4>
<p>
    If we could hire the Jedi Order and the Justice League to team up and protect your data, we would. Since they are unavailable, our engineers have used industry best practices every step of the way to make Swellcoin secure. From an encrypted connection at login to industry standard hashing algorithms, we have created multiple layers of security to guard your information.
</p>

<h4>Account Access</h4>
<p>
    Our day-to-day operations do not require us to access or interact with customer data. For this reason, the number of Swellcoin team members that can access your financial data is zero.
</p>
<p>
    When you create a Swellcoin account, the password you choose is required to be a minimum of eight characters. The only person who knows the password you choose is you. All passwords are hashed using industry standard hashing algorithms. This means that even we can't see your password. The only time you will ever use your Swellcoin password is when you login. A Swellcoin team member will never ask you for your login information.

<h4>Third Party Financial Data Aggregator</h4>

<p>
    We do not store, nor have access to, your bank credentials.  Swellcoin believes critical financial and account data must remain in the protective walls of the banking and financial industry security experts. We have partnered our card linking portal with Finicity, a leader in financial services for over 16,000+ banks and credit card companies. Using the same level of security as your bank, Finicity provides to Swellcoin a read-only snapshot of your spending data (post date, merchant ID and amount spent) to calculate your cash-back rewards with member businesses. Swellcoin never has access to your credentials, cards, or accounts in any manner whatsoever.
