    Swellcoin believes critical financial and account data must remain in the protective walls of the banking and financial industry
    security experts. We have partnered our card linking portal with Finicity, a leader in financial services for over 16,000+
    banks and credit card companies. Using the same level of security as your bank, Finicity provides to Swellcoin a read-only
    snapshot of your spending data (post date, merchant ID and amount spent) to calculate your cash-back rewards with member
    businesses. Swellcoin never has access to your credentials, cards, or accounts in any manner whatsoever.
