<h3 class="page-title brand-green">About Card Linking</h3>
<p>
    Swellcoin uses the same card linking methods as Mint, Quickbooks and PayPal via our partners <a href="https://www.finicity.com/security/">Finicity</a> and <a href="https://www.experian.com/corporate/about-experian.html">Experian</a>. As leading financial security experts and trusted partners with banks nationwide, Finicity / Experian do all the heavy lifting to link your cards and secure a copy of your digital transactions (purchases and returns). They are then provided to Swellcoin in a read-only format to calculate your cashback, all with bank level security. Swellcoin never has access to your account(s) or credentials in any manner whatsoever. You may un-link your card(s) at any time, or add or change cards as desired.
